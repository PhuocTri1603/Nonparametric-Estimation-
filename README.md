# Nonparametric-Estimation-
In the strong effort to free discriminatory analysis from tight assumptions by applying nonparametric estimates, Fix &amp; Hodges (1951) theoretically proved that with the large enough dataset, the nonparametric estimates are consistent (consistency in the sense of decision functions) with likelihood ratio procedure (procedures, as the author said, are believed to have ideal properties concerning control of possibility of misclassification). \
They considered that in the case of data without normal distribution or equal covariance matrices, the validity of the estimates of the linear discriminant function (most familiar parametric procedure at that time) is doubtful. This insight is supported by both theoretical and empirical works. In the book that presented the topic of nonparametric analysis with density estimation, Silverman (1998) said that the linear rule is not able to perform well with data with non-normal distribution, such as clusters; the nonparametric rule has the availability to deal with this feature in the data. He pointed out by generalizing the ideas of density estimation, nonparametric discrimination can be extended to deal with discrete and mixed data. However, this procedure requires extremely large sample sizes, especially if the data are of high dimensionality. Fortunately, the smoothing dimensional algorithm of density estimation procedures can resolve this problem.
